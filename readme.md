# Auto-Resume

This is pretty much an automation project to help me update my resume easily, that said feel free to download it and mess around if you want. 

This program takes CV informaton from a JSON file and compiles it into a defined LaTeX template.
`makeResume.py` contains code that reads data from `resumeData.json` and writes it to files according to a format defined in (for this example) `russelFormat.py`, which contains functions that map the JSON data to string outputs for the format defined in `texFiles/russell.cls`.
I encourage anyone who likes this idea to implement other LaTeX formats that can read and compile the information in `resumeData.json`.

### Next Steps
- [X] Run everything with one command
- [X] Standardize `makeResume.py`, options in a JSON or XML file.
- [] Implement more LaTeX formats.
- [] Allow user to specify which format to use in the settings file.

### Credit
The russell class is available on its own at https://github.com/themagicalmammal/Resume, all credit for the latex class and the base `resume.tex` file goes to the contributors to that repository.

*this is not a forked repository since the .tex files & definitions are intended to be an example for using this format to add more LaTeX resume templates.*

### Requirements

Python 3.x must be installed on your computer

To compile your finised files, install a LaTeX compiler for your system. I am using MiKTeX due to its small size:
- Install: https://miktex.org/

### Filling in the JSON

- `resumeData.json` is currently filled with my personal CV information as an example (feel free to hire me). You can test the file generation with this, or fill in your own information. *NOTE: Entries on the resume pdf will appear in the order they are listed in the `resumeData.json` file.*

- `resumeDataFormat.json` contains JSON in the same fomat as `resumeData.json` but with blank entries. You can either copy this and fill in your information, or use it as a guideline. Be careful not to make any changes to the format of the JSON files without ensuring the change is represented in each one, and that it won't mess with the code in `makeResume.py`.

- [NOTE: not implemented yet]`resumeOptions.json` contains optional specifications for content to be included in the resume, empty by default
    - 'keywords': list of keywords, resume will only contain sections from `resumeData.json` that contain matching keywords (ie. relevant-skills, etc.). These are overwritten/ignored if the '-k' cmd argument is used to specify keywords.
    - 'sections-to-include': list of sections within `/CVout` that are to be included in the final pdf. Any new sections/extensions to the code must be listed here in order to appear. This list also represents the order that the sections will appear in the final pdf. If this list is empty, all sections in the `/CVout` folder will appear in alphabetical order by filename.

### Running/Compiling

Quick Run:
- run `py makeResume.py` to run all processes and generate a resume.pdf file in `/texFiles`


Run Individually:

Step 1:
- run `py makeTexFiles.py`
- The .tex files should be created and put in `/CVout`

Step 2:
- navigate to text folder: `cd texFiles`
- run `xelatex resume.tex`
    - If this is your first time running, MiKTeX will need to install all requirements. I recommend un-checking "show me every time" as there are a lot of packages and it'll get annyoying OK-ing each one.
    - You may be able to compile with other LaTeX commands/formats. `pdflatex` did not work for me so I use `xelatex`.


Command Line Args (`makeTexFiles.py` & `makeResume.py`):

- `-k`: specify keywords in the console (only include experience/projects/volunteer with specific relevant-skills), run with 
    - `-k` on its own will run the script with no keywords & will include everything in `resumeData.json`
    - accepts cmd entries up until another reserved cmd arg appears.
- `-e`: specify sections to exclude from the final pdf
    - if a section given does not exist there will be no effect.
- `-a`: ignore `resumeOptions.json` and include all files in `/CVout` in alphabetical order
    - sections excluded via keywords or `-e` will still be excluded
- `-n`: set the name of the output PDF *NOTE: `makeResume.py` ONLY*
    - NOTE: `-n resume.pdf` will output `resume.pdf.pdf`
    - default filename is `resume`

- example: `py makeResume.py -k 1 2 3 -e 4 5 6`
    - keywords: 1, 2, 3
    - excluding: 4, 5, 6
- where `resumeOptions.json` contains 'keywords': [ 'ai' ]
    - `py makeResume.py -k -e 4 5 6`
        - keywords: []
        - excluding: 4, 5, 6
    - `py makeResume.py -e 4 5 6`
        - keywords: ai
        - excluding: 4, 5, 6, ...any sections without 'ai' in their 'relevant-skills' field.
